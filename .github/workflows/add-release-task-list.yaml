            Please complete the following tasks before merging this PR:
            - [ ] update dependencies (`cargo update` + check `cargo outdated`)
            - [ ] update `zugkontrolle-macros/lizenzen` folder
              - clean current licenses
              - run `fetch_licenses.py`
              - check if everything still compiles (e.g. `.gitkeep`-files for fonts were not deleted)
              - commit result
            - [ ] update `Changelog.md`, so all included changes appear under the <version> section
            - [ ] update `zugkontrolle.desktop`
